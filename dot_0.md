This is a livestream .0 outline (background and context live video.)

**Overview:**  
- This .0 video is an introduction to the Active InferAnts project
- Active InferAnts applying Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to Ants. 
- We are using various methods including synthetic intelligence and symbolic co-creation techniques.

- We are using cursor.sh for development and utilizing GPT-4 as our core computational model 
- After hours of nestmate-in-the-loop collaboration within the cursor.sh niche, a milestone prototype of Active InferAnts v1. scheme was reached
